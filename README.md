# sxsw-zine

## Project Goals
- explore using next.js and Vercel tooling
- explore AI tooling, like copilot and Vercel's v0
- create a creative and minimal photo gallery to share the bands I got to see during SXSW 2024, at least something better than instagram
- provide relevant links to bands when possible
- provide an easy way for bands to download all pictures I captured of them


## Resources Used:
https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Boilerplate

## Everything below was from boilerplate

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
